                            <p>The rise of technology has drastically changed our way of life in the past decade. Everything is at our fingertips — our friends, shopping and even our finances. There's nothing you can't do from the comfort of your own home.</p>

                            <p>But this convenience comes at a cost.</p>
                                
                            <p>Slowly but surely, over the past decade, the providers of these services — the mega-tech conglomerates like Amazon and Google — have built an empire of influence over society. They've established their dominance in the market and their services are used globally. They collect data from their vast userbase, using the massive amounts of data to manipulate the general public. Even worse, these capitalistic corporations are built off of exploitation of the very same userbase. </p>
                                
                            <p>In the 21st century, tech is inherently political. We aim to show how every product is embedded within a political system of exploitation.<br></p>
