# Hover and Discover 

## Project Overview
Hover and Discover is a web page that aims to raise awareness about the dominance of tech moguls in the production of technology most people rely on every day. By displaying a visual graphic of a normal living space, under the presumption that the average user living space will resemble the one displayed, the user is prompted to identify pieces of technology interspersed in this space, upon the clicking of which, a prompt is displayed to reveal a fact about a major tech company known for the manufacturing of the particular product. The facts revealed will hopefully have the user think critically and ethically about our current dependency on these tech moguls who dominate the tech industry and are powerful enough to use their control in egregously reprehensible ways. 

## Project Idea
Visiting topics across the semester such as surveillance, big data, and labor led to the generation of the idea behind the project.
